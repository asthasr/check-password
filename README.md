# check-password

Checks a password against the ["Pwned Passwords" API][api-docs] This is
provided for the benefit of the (sensible) people who feel uneasy about
entering their passwords into someone else's web page. The code here is
intentionally simple; you can see that it does not send your password across
the Internet.

To use it on a Unix-like OS, you can use it as an executable:

    chmod +x ./check-password
    ./check-password

You will be prompted for the password you want to check.

On other systems, you should be able to run the script using Python 3, although
it has not been tested.
